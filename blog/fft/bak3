#section Introduction
In competitive programming, the Fast Fourier Transform is a technique that speeds up polynomial multiplication from $O(N^2)$ to $O( N \log N)$. In this article, we will explore the basic concepts behind this speedup and its implementation and applications.

#section Multiplying Polynomials
First, let's recap what a polynomial is:
#block Defintion
A polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $n$ is defined as $$f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_nx^n$$
where $a_0, \dots, a_n$ are numbers.
#end block
It's common to include the restriction $a_n \neq 0$, but for later convenience, we won't introduce this restriction.

We can multiply polynomials to get a new polynomial. Suppose $f(x) = a_0 + a_1 + \dots + a_nx^n$ and $g(x) = b_0 + b_1 + \dots + b_nx^n$ are both polynomials of degree $n$. Let $h(x) = f(x)g(x)$ be their product. We can calculate $h(x)$ by distributing and collecting the terms:
$$\begin{align} h(x) &= f(x)g(x)\\&=(a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^n)(b_0 + b_1x + \dots + b_nx^n)\\&= \sum_{i = 0}^n\sum_{j = 0}^n a_ib_jx^{i+j} \end{align}$$

The product $h(x) = f(x)g(x) = c_0 + c_1x + \dots + c_{2n}x^{2n}$ is a polynomial of degree $2n$. We can find the $k$-th coefficient $c_k$ for all $0 \leq k \leq 2n$ by adding all $a_ib_j$ such that $i + j = k$. To do this, we loop thourgh all $i$ from 0 to $k$ inclusive and set $j = k - i$. 

#block Theorem
If $$\begin{align}f(x) &= a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^n\\g(x) &= b_0 + b_1x + \dots + a_nx^n \\h(x) = f(x)g(x) &= c_0 + c_1x + \dots + c_{2n}x^{2n}\end{align}$$then for all $0 \leq k \leq 2n$,
$$c_k = \sum_{i = 0}^k a_ib_{k - i}$$
#end block

Note that this formula takes $O(n^2)$ time to compute $c_k$ for all $0 \leq k \leq 2n$, despite it only being $O(n)$ space of information. There seems to be a neat structure to the computation, so there's probably room for improvement by reusing calculations. This is where the Fast Fourier Transform comes in.
#end section

#section Sampling and Interpolating
A polynomial $f(x) = a_0 + \dots + a_nx^n$ can be represented by only its coefficients $a_0, \dots, a_n$. However, if we know its value at enough points, we can also determine the coefficients of the polynomial.
#block Theorem
Let $f(x) = a_0 + \dots + a_nx^n$ be a polynomial with degree $n$ whose coefficients $a_0, \dots, a_n$ are unknown. For any choice of distinct numbers $s_0, \dots, s_n$, if we know $f(s_0), \dots, f(s_n)$, then we can uniquely determine $a_0, \dots, a_n$.
#end block
Let's call the choice of distinct numbers $s_0, \dots, s_n$ <i>sampling points</i> and the values of $f(s_0), \dots f(s_n)$ <i>samples</i>. Note that while the samples uniquely determine the coefficients, the samples themselves aren't unique because any choice of distinct sampling points will work.

We call the process of calculating samples from the polynomial in coefficient form <i>sampling</i> and the process of determining the coefficients from samples <i>interpolating</i>.
#end section

#section Speedup Overview
For the sake of later convenience, we'll talk about multiplying polynomials of degree $n - 1$ from now on.

Let $f(x) = a_0 + \dots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}$ and $g(x) = b_0 + \dots + b_{n-1}x^{n-1}$ be polynomials of degree $n - 1$. Instead of multiplying them directly, we'll first sample both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ at sample points $s_0, \dots, s_{2n - 1}$, calculating $f(s_0), \dots, f(s_{2n - 1})$ as well as $g(s_0), \dots, g(s_{2n - 1})$.

Then we'll pointwise multiply the samples, calculating $f(s_0)g(s_0), \dots f(s_{2n - 1})g(s_{2n - 1})$. The theorem from the previous section tells us that this is enough to recover the coefficients of $f(x)g(x)$, since we have $2n$ samples and $f(x)g(x)$ is of degree $2n - 2$. Once we do that, we've calculated $f(x)g(x)$.

If we can quickly sample and interpolate polynomials, then we can quickly multiply polynomials since the pointwise multiplication step only takes $O(N)$ time.
#end section

#section Primitive Roots of Unity
We have the luxury of picking whichever $2n$ sample points $s_0, \dots s_{2n - 1}$ we want, but if we want both sampling and interpolation to be fast, we better pick sample points that allow us to reuse calculations.

The type of number that will allow us to do this is the primitive roots of unity.
#block Definition
A number $\om_n$ is said to be an $n$-th root of unity (for some positive integer $n$) if $\om_n^n =1 $.
<br/><br/>
In addition, a $n$-th root of unity $\om_n$ is said to be <i>primitive</i> if for all $0 < k < n$, $\om_n^k \neq 1$.
#end block

In the real numbers, only $1$ and $-1$ could possibly be roots of unity, but not primitive $n$-th roots of unity for $n > 2$, so we'll have to use a different number system. If you're familiar with complex numbers or the integers modulo a prime number, you might know examples of primitive roots of unity. However, we only need to work with the above definition to be able to prove these important properties:

// TODO fix up theorems to have n/2 instead
#block Theorem
Let $\om_m$ be a primitive $m$-th root of unity and $\om_{2n}$ be a primitive $2n$-th root of unity.
<ol>
	<li>For all $0 < k < m$, the values of $\om_m^k$ are distinct</li>
	<li>$\om_{2n}^n = -1$</li>
	<li>For any $k$, $(\om_{2n}^k)^2 = (\om_{2n}^{n + k})^2 = \om_n^k$ where $\om_n$ is some primitive $n$-th root of unity</li>
	<li>
		If $0 < k < n$, then $\om_n^0 + \om_n^k + \om_n^{2k} + \dots + \om_n^{(n-1)k} = 0$.
	</li>
</ol>

<div class="subheading">Proof of #1</div>
Suppose the statement isn't true: that there exist $k_1$ and $k_2$ such that $0 < k_1 < k_2 < m$ and $\om_m^{k_1} = \om_m^{k_2}$. If we divide both sides by $\om_m^{k_1}$, we then get $\om_m^{k_2 - k_1} = 1$. But since $0 < k_1 < k_2 < m$, we have $0 < k_2 - k_1 < m$, and by the definition of primitivity, $\om_m^{k_2 - k_1}$ can't be $1$. We reach a contradiction so the values of $\om_m^k$ must indeed be distinct.

<div class="subheading">Proof of #2</div>
Since $(\om_{2n}^n)^2 = \om_{2n}^{2n} = 1$, we know that $\om_{2n}^n$ must be either $-1$ or $1$. However, since $\om_{2n}$ is primitive and $0 < n < 2n$, $\om_{2n}^n \neq 1$, so it must be $-1$.

<div class="subheading">Proof of #3</div>
We can verify this by the definitions: $(\om^2_{2n})^n = \om^{2n}_{2n} = 1$. Also, for any $0 < k < n$, $(\om^2_{2n})^k = \om^{2k}_{2n}$, and since $0 < k < n \implies 0 < 2k < 2n \implies \om^{2k}_{2n} \neq 1$. We can also write this result as $\om^2_{2n} = \om_n$.

As a result, we also get the property that $(\om^k_{2n})^2 = (\om^2_{2n})^k = \om_{n}^k$. Also, by combining results above, we have $(\om_{2n}^{n + k})^2 = (\om_{2n}^n\om_{2n}^k)^2 = (-1)^2(\om_{2n}^k)^2 = \om_{n}^k$.

<div class="subheading">Proof of #4</div>
If $k$ is divisible by $n$, then there exists some $j$ for which $nj = k$. Then
$$\begin{align}c &= \om_n^0 + \om_n^k + \om_n^{2k} + \dots + \om_n^{(n-1)k} \\ &= \om_n^0 + \om_n^{nj} + \om_n^{2nj} + \dots + \om_n^{(n-1)nj}\\&=\om_n^0 + (\om_n^{n})^j + (\om_n^{n})^{2j} + \dots + (\om_n^{n})^{(n-1)j}\\&=1+1^j+1^{2j}+\dots+1^{(n-1)j}\\&=n\end{align}$$

If $k$ is not divisible by $n$, then
$$\begin{align}c &= \om_n^0 + \om_n^k+ \dots + \om_n^{(n-1)k}\end{align}$$
Let's mutiply both sides by $1 - \om_n^k$.
$$\require{cancel}\begin{align}c(1 -\om_n^k) &= (\om_n^0 + \om_n^k + \dots + \om_n^{(n-1)k})(1-\om_n^k)\\c(1-\om_n^k)&=(\om_n^0 + \om_n^k + \dots + \om_n^{(n-1)k})-\om_n^k(\om_n^0 + \om_n^k + \dots + \om_n^{(n-1)k})\\c(1-\om_n^k)&=\om_n^0+\om_n^k+\dots+\om_n^{(n-1)k}-\om_n^k-\om_n^{2k}-\dots-\om_n^{nk}\\c(1-\om_n^k)&=\om_n^0+\cancel{\om_n^k}+\dots+\cancel{\om_n^{(n-1)k}}-\cancel{\om_n^k}-\cancel{\om_n^{2k}}-\dots-\om_n^{nk}\\c(1-\om_n^k)&=(\om_n^0-\om_\end{align}$$
#end section

#section Sampling Quickly
Let $f(x) = a_0 + \dots + a_{2n-1}x^{2n-1}$ be an $2n - 1$ degree polyomial. We define two $n - 1$ degree polynomials, $f_e$ keeping only the coefficients at even degree and $f_o$ keeping only the coefficients at odd degree:
$$\begin{align}f_e(x)&=a_0 + a_2x + a_4x^2 + \dots+ a_{2n -2}x^{n-1}\\f_o(x)&=a_1+a_3x + a_5x^2 + \dots + a_{2n-1}x^{n-1}\end{align}$$

Now let $\om$ be a primitive $2n$-th root of unity. We'll drop the subscript $_{2n}$ for now for convenience. We can conveniently evaluate $f(\om^k)$ from just $f_e(\om^{2k})$ and $f_o(\om^{2k})$:
$$\begin{align} f_e(\om^{2k}) + \om^kf_o(\om^{2k})&=\left(a_0 + a_2\om^{2k} + \dots + a_{2n-2}\om^{2k(n - 1)}\right)+\om^k\left(a_1+a_3\om^{2k}+\dots+a_{2n-1}\om^{2k(n-1)}\right)\\&=\left(a_0+a_2\om^{2k}+\dots+a_{2n-2}\om^{(2n-2)k}\right)+\left(a_1\om^k+a_3\om^{3k}+\dots+a_{2n-1}\om^{(2n-1)k}\right)\\&=a_0+a_1\om^k+a_2\om^{2k}+a_3\om^{3k}+\dots+a_{2n-2}\om^{(2n-2)k}+a_{2n-1}\om^{(2n-1)k}\\&=f(\om^k)\end{align}$$

Let's bring the subscript $_{2n}$ so we can manipulate the result that we found. If $\om_{2n}$ is a primitive $2n$-th root of unity then
$$\begin{align}f(\om_{2n}^k)&=f_e(\om_{2n}^{2k}) + \om_{2n}^k f_o(\om_{2n}^{2k})\\&=f_e((\om_{2n}^k)^2 + \om_{2n}^kf_o((\om_{2n}^k)^2)\\&=f_e(\om_n^k)+\om_{2n}^kf_o(\om_n^k)\end{align}$$
This formula works for all $0 \leq k < 2n$, but if we restrict $k$ to the range $0 \leq k < n$ and consider both $k$ and $k + n$, we find a very special pattern:
$$\begin{align}f(\om_{2n}^k)&=f_e(\om_n^k)+\om_{2n}^kf_o(\om_n^k)\end{align}$$
as expected, but
$$\begin{align}f(\om_{2n}^{k + n})&=f_e(\om_n^{k + n})+\om_{2n}^{k + n}f_o(\om_n^{k + n})\\&=f_e(\om_n^k\om_n^n) + \om_{2n}^n \om_{2n}^k f_o(\om_n^k\om_n^n)\\&=f_e(\om_n^k) - \om_{2n}^k f_o(\om_n^k)\end{align}$$

To recap, we've found that
#block Theorem
If
$$\begin{align}f(x)&= a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2+ \dots + a_{2n-1}x^{2n-1}\\f_e(x)&=a_0 + a_2x + a_4x^2 + \dots+ a_{2n -2}x^{n-1}\\f_o(x)&=a_1+a_3x + a_5x^2 + \dots + a_{2n-1}x^{n-1}\end{align}$$
and $\om_{2n}$ be a primitive $2n$-th root of unity, then for all $0 \leq k < n$,
$$\begin{align}f(\om_{2n}^k) &= f_e(\om^k_n) + \om^kf_o(\om^k_n)\\f(\om_{2n}^{k+n})&=f_e(\om^k_n) - \om^kf_o(\om^k_n)\end{align}$$
#end block
This is an extremely important formula. This means that if we need to sample $f(x)$ at $\om_{2n}^0, \om_{2n}^1, \dots \om_{2n}^{2n-1}$, we can reduce this into the problem of sampling $f_e(x)$ and $f_o(x)$ at $\om_n^0, \om_n^1, \dots \om_n^{n-1}$ with a cost of $O(n)$ steps.

At first glance, this doesn't help at all. In order to calculate $2n$ samples, we need to calculate $n$ samples for each of the functions $f_e$ and $f_o$, which is still $2n$ samples in total.

What if we kept using this formula over and over again? Let $n$ be a power of two, say $n = 2^k$. Suppose we have a polynomial of degree $n - 1$ and want to find $n$ samples. With a cost of $O(n)$ steps, we can reduce the problem into finding $\frac{n}{2}$ samples for $2$ polynomials of degree $\frac{n}{2} - 1$. If we apply the formula to each of the smaller polynomials, then with a cost of $2 \times \frac{n}{2} = O(n)$, we can reduce the problem further to finding $\frac{n}{4}$ samples for $4$ polynomials of degree $\frac{n}{4} - 1$.

Eventually, after $k$ iterations of this, with each iteration incurring a cost of $O(n)$ steps, the problem is reduced to finding one sample for $n$ polynomials each of degree $0$. This is now trivial to do since a sample of a polynomial $f(x) = a_0$ of degree $0$ is just $a_0$, so this step takes $O(n)$ time. In total, since $n = 2^k$, then $k = \log n$, so we spent $O(n) \times O(\log n) = O(n \log n)$ time reducing the problem to the trivial form, and $O(n)$ time solving the trivial form. Therefore, we've found a way to take $n$ samples in just $O(n)$ time.

#block Sampling Algorithm
Let $n$ be a power of $2$, $f(x) = a_0 + \dots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}$ be a polynomial of degree $n - 1$ and $\om_{n}$ be a primitive $n$-th root of unity.

To calculate $n$ samples $f(\om_n^0), f(\om_n^1), \dots, f(\om_n^{n-1})$:
