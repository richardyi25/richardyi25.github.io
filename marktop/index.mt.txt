#section General Syntax Rules
A section starts with the syntax <pre>#keyword [Description]</pre> and ends with the syntax<pre>#end keyword</pre>

Indentation is currently not supported; do not begin any line with whitespace.

All article paragraphs must be on the same line. All empty lines are ignored. Any HTML code is treated as such.

Since #, &lt, and &gt; are special characters, they must be written as &amp;#35; &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; respectively.
#end section

#section Syntax
<b><pre>#site-title [Title]</pre></b>

Set the &lt;title&gt; tag to [Title].

<hr>

<b><pre>#title [Title]</pre></b>

Set the article title to [Title].

<hr>

<b><pre>#warning</pre></b>

Generate a warning alerting visitors that the article is incomplete or unfinished.

<hr>

<b><pre>#toc</pre></b>

Automatically generate a table of contents based on the sections (see below).

<hr>

<b><pre>#latex-preamble</pre></b>
<b><pre>[preamble]</pre></b>
<b><pre>#end latex-preamble</pre></b>

A place to write LaTeX code that will be hidden on the website. Useful for defining functions such as using

<pre>\DeclareMathOperator*{\special}{special}</pre>

so that it can be used similar to a summation:
$$ \special_{i = 0}^{N} f(i) $$

<hr>

<b><pre>#main</pre></b>
<b><pre>#end main</pre></b>

The declaration marks the start and end of the actual article content, which is divided into sections (see below).

<hr>

<b><pre>#section [Title]</pre></b>
<b><pre>#end section</pre></b>

[Title] is the title of the section. These mark a section, which is how one topic of the article.

Sections may only be defined within the main tags.

<hr>

<b><pre>#block</pre></b>
<b><pre>#end block</pre></b>

A block is meant to highlight a definition or bring focus to an idea.

Below is an example:

#block Newton's Second Law of Motion
$$ F_{net} = ma $$
#end block

<hr>

<b><pre>#code [Highlight]</pre></b>
<b><pre>#end code</pre></b>

This displays the text between the tags to be displayed as code, using Prism.js.

[Highlight] described the lines to be highlighted. The syntax is as follows:

<pre>start1-end1,start2-end2,...</pre>

The range of lines is described using start-end (inclusive), and ranges are separated by commas.

The current default is C++ highlighting, and more support will be added at a later time.

Below is an example:

#code 10-11
// Here is some C++ code
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(){
	int a, b;
	std::cin >> a >> b;
	std::cout << a + b;
}

// This line
// and this line should be highlighted
#end code

Again, #, &lt, and &gt; are special characters, and they must be escaped.

<b>LaTeX support</b>

The special characters for LaTeX are \$ for inline and \$\$ for display mode. LaTeX display is powered by MathJax.

Here is an example of inline LaTeX: Newton's Second Law of Motion is written as $F_{net} = ma$, which describes the relationship between the net force, mass, and acceleration of an object.

Here is an example of display-mode LaTeX:
$$ F_{net} = ma $$

#end section

#end main
