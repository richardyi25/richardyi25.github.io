				Centroid Decomposition Explanation
			</div>
			<p>
				Centroid decomposition is an advanced divide-and-conquer technique on trees.
				The centroid of the tree is found and marked as "removed", paritioning the tree into 
				subtrees with
				a size of half of the tree or fewer. This process is repeated until all nodes
				are marked as removed.
			</p>
			<p>
				We note that the depth of recursion is O(log N) so there are O(N log N) paths from a
				centroid to all of the other nodes in its subtree right before it was removed,
				and that any of the O(NÂ²) original paths in the tree can be formed by concatenting 
				two of the O(N log N) paths from the cenroid.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is of great convenience for problems querying non-trivial information on all paths of a tree.
