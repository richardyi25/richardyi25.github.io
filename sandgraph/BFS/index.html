				Breadth-First Search Explanation
			</div>
			<p>
				In a breadth-first search, we pick a node to initially visit into a queue and mark
				that it has been visited.
				We then repeatedly remove a node from the queue, and add its unvisited adjacent
				nodes into the queue, marking them visited. This loops until the queue is empty.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to the first-in, first-out nature of the queue, nodes are visited in order of
				shortest distance from the initial node. The shortest distance property only holds
				for unweighted graphs.
