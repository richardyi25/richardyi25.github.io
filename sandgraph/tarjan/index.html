					Tarjan's Lowlink Algorithm Explanation
				</div>
				<p>
					<b>Note:</b>
					This algorithm only deals with undirected graphs.
					Directed graphs require a small adjustment.
				</p>

				<p>
					In a <a href="../DFS/index.html">DFS</a>, if a node v was visited as
					an adjacent node of u, we call v the child of u and call u the parent of v.
					These parent-child relationships form a directed tree, which is called the DFS tree.
					Edges part of the DFS tree are called tree edges, while edges (u, v) that aren't are
					<ol>
						<li>Forward edges, if v is a descendant of u</li>
						<li>Back edges, if v is an ancestor of u</li>
						<li>Cross edges, otherwise</li>
					</ol>
					Undirected graphs do not have cross edges.
				</p>

				<p>
					Additionally, for all u, we store stamp[u], the timestamp of when the node was visited.
					We also store low[u], the lowlink of u, which is
					the smallest time stamp achievable by starting from u,
					following any number of tree edges, followed by at most one back edge.
				</p>

				<p>
					Tarjan's Lowlink Algorithm computes low[u] for each u in linear time using
					the following logic: <br/>

					Initialize time = 0. Inside the DFS call of node u,
					<ol>
						<li>Mark u as visited</li>
						<li>Set stamp[u] = low[u] = time</li>
						<li>Increment time by 1</li>
						<li>For each non-parent adjacent node v:</li>
							<ol>
								<li>If it's already been visited, set low[u] = min(low[u], stamp[v]), decreasing low[u] if (u, v) is a back edge</li>
								<li>If it hasn't been visited: Call DFS(v), then set low[u] = min(low[u], low[v]), <br/>possibly decreasing low[u] since (u, v) is a tree edge</li>
							</ol>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<p>
					A node is <b>cut vertex</b> or a <b>articulation point</b> if removing it disconnects the graph.
					This happens iff either
					<ol>
						<li>Node u is the root of the DFS tree (first node visited) and it has at least two children</li>
						<li>Node u is not the root and there exists a child v of u such that low[v] &geq; stamp[u]</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<p>
					An edge (u, v) is a <b>bridge</b> if removing it disconnects the graph.
					This happens iff either
					<ol>
						<li>low[v] &gt; stamp[u]</li>
						<li>low[u] &gt; stamp[v]</li>
					</ol>
